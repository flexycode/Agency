# Agency

Modern Digital Marketing Agency Website using Next JS, TailwindCSS, and Stripe integration
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
